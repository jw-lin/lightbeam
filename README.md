# lightbeam
Simulate light through weakly guiding waveguides using the finite-differences beam propagation method on an adaptive mesh.

## installation
The master branch includes the raw files of the beam propagation code. For a packaged version of the code, you can use the "package" branch. Just run <pip install git+https://github.com/jw-lin/lightbeam.git@package>. You will also need the following packages: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Numba, and Numexpr.
